The first thing that comes to mind while considering a task scheduler is
a cron job. As most of the today's servers are hosted on linux machines,
setting a cron job for periodic task might seem like a good option for
many. However in production having a crontab is nothing but a pain in
the a\*\*. It can be a bit tricky to configure different timezones
depending upon the location of the server.

The biggest problem with this approach is when the application is scaled
into multiple web servers. In that case instead of running one we could
be running multiple cron jobs which might lead to race conditions. Also
it's hard to debug if something goes wrong with the task.

With Flask there are multiple ways to address third problem and
[Celery](http://www.celeryproject.org/) is one of the most popular
ones. Celery addresses the above problems quite gracefully. It uses same
timezones of [pytz](https://pypi.org/project/pytz/) which helps in
calculating timezones and setting the scheduler timings accurately.

Celery uses a backend message broker (redis or RabbitMQ) to save the
state of the schedule which acts as a centralized database server for
multiple celery workers running on different web servers.The message
broker ensures that the task is run only once as per the schedule, hence
eliminating the race condition.

Monitoring real time events is also supported by Celery. It includes a
beautiful built-in terminal interface that shows all the current
events.A nice standalone project
[Flower](https://flower.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) provides a web
based tool to administer Celery workers and tasks.It also supports
asynchronous task execution which comes in handy for long running tasks.

```text
  flask-celery
  │
  │  app.py
  │  docker-compose.yml
  │  Dockerfile
  │  entrypoint.sh
  │  requirements.txt
  │
  └────────────────────────
```

Let's start with the Dockerfile

```dockerfile
  FROM python:3.7

  # Create a directory named flask
  RUN mkdir flask

  # Copy everything to flask folder
  COPY . /flask/

  # Make flask as working directory
  WORKDIR /flask

  # Install the Python libraries
  RUN pip3 install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

  EXPOSE 5000

  # Run the entrypoint script
  CMD ["bash", "entrypoint.sh"]
```

The packages required for this application are mentioned in the
requirement.txt file.

```text
  Flask==1.0.2
  celery==4.3.0
  redis==3.3.11
```

The entry point script goes here.

```sh
  #!/bin/sh

  flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port 5000
```

Celery uses a message broker to pass messages between the web app and
celery workers. Here we will setup a Redis container which will be used
as the message broker.

```dockerfile
  version: "3.7"

  services:

    redis:
      container_name: redis_dev_container
      image: redis
      ports:
        - "6379:6379"

    flask_service:
      container_name: flask_dev_container
      restart: always
      image: flask
      build:
        context: ./
        dockerfile: Dockerfile
      depends_on:
          - redis
      ports:
        - "5000:5000"
      volumes:
        - ./:/flask
      environment:
          - FLASK_DEBUG=1
```

Now we are all set to start our little experiment. We have a redis
container running on port 6379 and a flask container running on
`localhost:5000`. Let's add a simple api to test whether our tiny web
application works.

```python
  from flask import Flask

  app = Flask(__name__)

  @app.route("/")
  def index_view():
      return "Flask-celery task scheduler!"

  if __name__ == "__main__":
      app.run()
```

And voila!

<div class="post-image">
  <img src="/images/hello-scheduler.png" />
</div>

Now we will be building a simple timer application which will show the
elapsed time since the application has started. We need to configure
celery with the Redis server URL and also we will be using another Redis
database to store the time.

```python
  from flask import Flask
  from celery import Celery
  import redis

  app = Flask(__name__)

  # Add Redis URL configurations
  app.config["CELERY_BROKER_URL"] = "redis://redis:6379/0"
  app.config["CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND"] = "redis://redis:6379/0"

  # Connect Redis db
  redis_db = redis.Redis(
      host="redis", port="6379", db=1, charset="utf-8", decode_responses=True
  )

  # Initialize timer in Redis
  redis_db.mset({"minute": 0, "second": 0})

  # Add periodic tasks
  celery_beat_schedule = {
      "time_scheduler": {
          "task": "app.timer",
          # Run every second
          "schedule": 1.0,
      }
  }

# Initialize Celery and update its config
celery = Celery(app.name)
celery.conf.update(
    result_backend=app.config["CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND"],
    broker_url=app.config["CELERY_BROKER_URL"],
    timezone="UTC",
    task_serializer="json",
    accept_content=["json"],
    result_serializer="json",
    beat_schedule=celery_beat_schedule,
)


@app.route("/")
def index_view():
    return "Flask-celery task scheduler!"


@app.route("/timer")
def timer_view():
    time_counter = redis_db.mget(["minute", "second"])
    return f"Minute: {time_counter[0]}, Second: {time_counter[1]}"


@celery.task
def timer():
    second_counter = int(redis_db.get("second")) + 1
    if second_counter >= 59:
        # Reset the counter
        redis_db.set("second", 0)
        # Increment the minute
        redis_db.set("minute", int(redis_db.get("minute")) + 1)
    else:
        # Increment the second
        redis_db.set("second", second_counter)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
```

Let's update the `entrypoint.js` to run both Celery worker and beat
server as background processes.

```sh
  #!/bin/sh

  # Run Celery worker
  celery -A app.celery worker --loglevel=INFO --detach --pidfile=''

  # Run Celery Beat
  celery -A app.celery beat --loglevel=INFO --detach --pidfile=''

  flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port 5000
```

Our very own timer

<div class="post-image">
  <img src="/images/timer.png" />
</div>

> The application is only for demonstration purpose. The counter won't
> be accurate as the task processing time is not taken into account
> while calculating time.


## Monitoring events {#monitoring-events}

Celery has a rich support for monitoring various statistics for tasks,
workers and events. We need to log into the container to enable and
monitor events.

```sh
  docker exec -it flask_dev_container bash
```

Enable and list all events

```sh
  celery -A app.celery control enable_events

  celery -A app.celery events
```

This spins up a nice interactive terminal ui listing all the details of
the scheduled tasks.

<div class="post-image">
  <img src="/images/events.png" />
</div>


## Conclusion {#conclusion}

In this post I have used Celery as an better alternative to crontabs
even though the primary purpose of Celery is processing tasks queues.
Both Celery worker and beat server can be run on different containers as
running background processes on the web container is not regarded as
best practice.

Unless you are creating a stupid timer application.

Adios!
