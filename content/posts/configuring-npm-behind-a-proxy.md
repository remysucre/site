For people who work in a company and squeez out some of their time to
learn nodejs, setting up an dev-environment can be a real pain. Proxy
servers are pretty common in college and business type institutions.

You can locate your proxy settings from your browser's settings panel.


## Using Proxy with NPM {#using-proxy-with-npm}

Once you have obtained the proxy settings (server URL, port, username
and password); you need to configure your npm configurations as follows.

```sh
  npm config set proxy http://<username>:<password>@<proxy-server-url>:<port>
  npm config set https-proxy http://<username>:<password>@<proxy-server-url>:<port>
```

You would have to replace `<username>`, `<password>`,
`<proxy-server-url>`, `<port>` with the values specific to your proxy
server credentials.

These fields are optional. For instance, your proxy server might not
even require `<username>` and `<password>`, or that it might be running
on port 80 (in which case `<port>` is not required).

Once you have set these, your npm install, `npm i -g etc`. would work
properly.
