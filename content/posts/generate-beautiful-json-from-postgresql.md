PostgreSQL provides a set of built-in [JSON
creation functions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html#FUNCTIONS-JSON-CREATION-TABLE) that can be used to build basic JSON structures. This increases the performance up to 10 times more than building it at the back-end layer.

In order to proceed with some examples, first we need to setup a test
database.

```sql
  CREATE DATABASE jsonland
```

Let's create the following tables.

```sql
  CREATE TABLE "user" (
    id SERIAL NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    email_address VARCHAR(150),
    PRIMARY KEY(id)
  )

  CREATE TABLE team (
    id SERIAL NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    PRIMARY KEY(id)
  )

  CREATE TABLE team_user (
    id SERIAL NOT NULL,
    team_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY(team_id) REFERENCES "team" (id),
    FOREIGN KEY(user_id) REFERENCES "user" (id),
    PRIMARY KEY(id)
  )
```

Let's Seed the tables with random data.

```sql
  INSERT INTO "team" ("id", "name")
  VALUES (1, 'team1'), (2, 'team2');

  INSERT INTO "user" ("id", "name", "email_address")
  VALUES (1, 'user1', 'user1@mail.com'), (2, 'user2', 'user2@mail.com');

  INSERT INTO "team_user" ("id", "team_id", "user_id")
  VALUES (1, 1, 1), (2, 1, 2), (3, 2, 2);
```

We have created three tables i.e. `team`, `user` and `team_user`.
`team_user` table maps one-to-may the relationship between users and
teams.


## **1. Get the table data as JSON objects** {#1-get-the-table-data-as-json-objects}

```sql
  SELECT row_to_json("user") FROM "user";

  +-----------------------------------------------------------+
  | row_to_json                                               |
  |-----------------------------------------------------------|
  | {"id":1,"name":"user1","email_address":"user1@gmail.com"} |
  | {"id":2,"name":"user2","email_address":"user2@gmail.com"} |
  +-----------------------------------------------------------+
```

The above mentioned query will return all the columns of each row as
JSON objects.


## **2. Get the table data with specific columns** {#2-get-the-table-data-with-specific-columns}

We can specify the particular columns we need rather than getting all at
once.

```sql
  SELECT row_to_json(row('id', 'name')) FROM "user";

  +-------------------------+
  | row_to_json             |
  |-------------------------|
  | {"f1":"id","f2":"name"} |
  | {"f1":"id","f2":"name"} |
  +-------------------------+
```

Now certainly the keys `f1` and `f2` in the objects are not very useful
to us. We would rather want the column names instead of those keys.

```sql
  SELECT row_to_json(users) FROM (SELECT id, name FROM "user") AS users;

  +-------------------------+
  | row_to_json             |
  |-------------------------|
  | {"id":1,"name":"user1"} |
  | {"id":2,"name":"user2"} |
  +-------------------------+
```


## **3. Get the table data as a single JSON object** {#3-get-the-table-data-as-a-single-json-object}

The above examples return us multiple JSON objects(one for each row).
Ideally we would want a single array of these objects which won't need
any further manipulation at back-end layer.

```sql
  SELECT array_to_json(array_agg(row_to_json(users)))
      FROM (
          SELECT id, name from "user"
      ) users

  -- OR

  SELECT json_agg(row_to_json(users))
      FROM (
          SELECT id, name from "user"
      ) users

  +----------------------------------------------------+
  | json_agg                                           |
  |----------------------------------------------------|
  | [{"id":1,"name":"user1"}, {"id":2,"name":"user2"}] |
  +----------------------------------------------------+
```

In the above query we are aggregating all the JSON objects and using
`array_agg` and then converting them to JSON by applying `array_to_json`
function.

Also we could do the yield the same results by using `json_agg`
function, which results into an object instead of JSON string.


## **4. Build JSON object with multiple tables** {#4-build-json-object-with-multiple-tables}

We can also build a new JSON object by using `json_build_object` and
specify the keys and values. Let's create an object that will contain
data from both team and user table.

```sql
  SELECT json_build_object(
    'users', (SELECT json_agg(row_to_json("user")) from "user"),
    'teams', (SELECT json_agg(row_to_json("team")) from "team")
  )
```

This query generates a JSON structure that will have all the users and
teams each as arrays of objects.

```json
  {
    "users": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "user1",
        "email_address": "user1@mail.com"
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "name": "user2",
        "email_address": "user2@mail.com"
      }
    ],
    "teams": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "team1"
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "name": "team2"
      }
    ]
  }
```


## **5. Build JSON object by resolving foreign keys** {#5-build-json-object-by-resolving-foreign-keys}

We can generate JSON structures by resolving foreign key references and
joining multiple tables.

```sql
  select json_agg(row_to_json(tu))
      from (
          select id, (
              select row_to_json(team) from team where team_user.team_id = team.id
          ) team, (
              select row_to_json("user") from "user" where team_user.user_id = "user".id
          ) "user"
      from team_user
  ) tu
```

This query contains multiple sub-queries to generate a complex
structure. It resolved the references of `team_id` and `user_id` into
the corresponding row.

```json
[
    {
      "id": 1,
      "team": {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "team1"
      },
      "user": {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "user1",
        "email_address": "user1@mail.com"
      }
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "team": {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "team1"
      },
      "user": {
        "id": 2,
        "name": "user2",
        "email_address": "user2@mail.com"
      }
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "team": {
        "id": 2,
        "name": "team2"
      },
      "user": {
        "id": 2,
        "name": "user2",
        "email_address": "user2@mail.com"
      }
    }
  ]
```


## **Conclusion** {#conclusion}

Even though PostgreSQL is almost always faster than the back-end
language based JSON generation, the query can get complex really quickly
as we have nested structures. As long as we understand the basic JSON
functions and sub-queries we can build almost any kind of structure
without stressing the back-end processes.
