I recently left a huge IT corporation for a promising startup.I was
asked to change my GitHub handler name as it was too cool(I think) for
them.Well instead of changing I created another account using my company
email.

Now I got a problem.Every day when I come home and start hacking around
my own projects I had to manually set my username and email id in git
config in order to reflect my contributions in the graph and most of the
time I forget to do so.

So I created some aliases to toggle between my two handles.

```sh
  # Set user 1 as current user
  gitfirst() {
      git config --global user.email 'xxx.yyyy@gmail.com' && git config --global user.name 'mrprofessor'
      gituser
  }

  # Set user 2 as current user
  gitsecond() {
      git config --global user.email 'zzzzz@corporation.com' && git config --global user.name 'rudrabot'
      gituser
  }

  # Print current user
  gituser() {
      git config --global user.name && git config --global user.email
  }
```

And that five minute I save every day from this hack..spends for...I
don't know.

Adios.
