Guess it's time to retrospect the last 12 months.

I will be talking about topics that I have worked on or learned. These
are listed in no particular order.


## **Python** {#python}

In June I switched my job and accepted a position of a back-end
developer in a fairly new company with a brand new project. The tech
stack was python and angular. Even though Python was my first love, by
that time I was more of a JavaScript guy rather than a Pythonista.
Luckily I got more than enough support from my team to understand the
implemented code base and in no time I was comfortable enough finish
several Jira tasks.

I have learned Flask as it is the _de facto_ framework for all the
projects we have been building here. I couldn't help but notice how
similar it was to express.js, which in fact helped me accelerating my
learning.

Python is so straight forward and fun, sometimes I wonder why I left it
in the first place.


## **React** {#react}

Even though I have been building React applications for more than two
years, This year, particularly the first half in
[Turbot](https://turbot.com) I got an opportunity to build/contribute
to a project which helped me understand the design patterns around a
front-end application, code-splitting, authorization, authentication and
much more.


## **Touch typing** {#touch-typing}

This is something I am actually proud of.

Fortunately I was able to get a job that respects the work life balance
everybody should have. Ironically given the fact that I had little
difference between work and my life(my cat sighs 😾!), I chose to develop
some nerd powers that I have been dreaming to have for a long time.I
have always wanted to learn touch typing since I saw one of my
ex-colleague writing code at 80wpm.

I never actually got time to practice/focus on it until after June, when
I changed my job and joined the above mentioned company. The project was
in its infancy and all I had to do is write code without looking down at
my keyboard. I will admit, it was really tough to break an ancient
practice of peeking and typing until I replaced my keyboard keycaps with
blank ones.

Also [10fastfingers.com](https://10fastfingers.com/) and
[typingclub](https://www.typingclub.com/) were a great help in
practicing too.


## **vi** {#vi}

This year was monumental for my personal vim experience.

My vim configuration got much matured. Coupling with touch-typing I
almost felt like a Wizard I always wanted to be. I even wrote some posts
on customizing vim for different purposes too.

Pretty good huh!


## **epilogue** {#epilogue}

Honestly it was a pretty good year for me. A new job, new city and a
bunch of cool stuff to learn!

Hope Loki approves this post.

He got me this year too.
