I'm a PhD student at [uwdb][18] and [uwplse][1] advised by [Dan Suciu][19]. 
I [optimize large scale machine learning code][20] by exploiting the connection 
between linear algebra and relation algebra. 

Before coming to Seattle, I was extremely lucky to work with Professor [Kathleen Fisher][13] and [Diogenes Nunez][14] at Tufts. They [lead me into research][12] and convinced me to keep doing it. Even before that, Professor [Norman Ramsey][15] taught me almost everything I knew about programming using [How to Design Programs][16]. 

After I left the East Coast, my [counterpart][17] continues to conduct interdisciplinary studies in a great environment. 

You can reach me via [email][8], or find me in 
the plse lab (Gates 253).
