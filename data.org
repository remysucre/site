I build large and scalable web applications at work. I dream of building
tiny and useful applications at home.

I can probably free up some hours in a week for software consulting if I
like your idea. You can even hire me full-time if you are shipping
applications with a
[[https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html][Free Software
Foundation]] license.

If you need any help regarding any of my articles do drop a comment
instead sending me e-mails.

Thanks for showing interest. Go away now. Bye!

I have heard it many times and I have had enough.

Some devs(mostly junior) come up to me and ask what to build as a side
project and my answer always has been is to build something that you see
everyday and improve if possible. Then the next thing I get is "I wanna
build that but it already exists" or something like "Even if I build it
I can't show it on my resume because there is a better alternative."

IT DOESN'T MATTER.

If people stop doing things that are already done, there won't be any
Tour de France every year. No one would climb up Everest again. No
country would spend millions for a Man-on-Moon mission.

THIS IS JUST FULL BLOWN HYPOCRISY.

When a developer builds an Instagram clone, it's actually means that he
has single handedly created an application which was actually developed
by an army of engineers in the first place. It shows nothing but the
capability and understanding of the developer.

In fact once you build something like and Instagram clone, you would get
to know how real world projects actually work behind the scenes. You
could make some changes and take decisions that the original engineers
couldn't afford. That could even open up a possibility to improve some
skills in certain areas.

So bottom line is if you find any project that's fun, copy it, reverse
engineer it, go nuts and make it happen. There is nothing wrong with
reinventing the wheel.

*** *New project*
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: new-project
    :END:

In January, I started working on a project named *Solitude*. It's a note
taking application which is using GitHub as a CMS. It will create and
maintain a repository of notes and will sync them in real-time. The
design is inspired from [[https://utteranc.es/][utteranc.es]] which uses
GitHub issues to store blog comments. This website uses Utterances too.

Solitude aims to be a very opinionated and self-controlled note taking
application. Hence the contents of the solitude-maintained repository
should only be modified by the application in order to maintain a stable
state.

I am using React, Redux and GitHub's graphQL API to build this
application. Also using [[https://codemirror.net][Codemirror]] as the
note taking editor.

The hardest part building this application is to rememeber technologies
that I haven't used in almost an year.

New project ideas 1. A micro server to authenticate GitHub 2. Minimal
static site generator

I will be using python to build both the projects.

*** *New languages*
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: new-languages

I have been writting Javascript and Python for the pase 4 years and I
have always believed that these two are enough to satisfy all my needs
as web developer. Then I came accross a
[[https://youtu.be/OyfBQmvr2Hc][Talk]] and I decided that I gotta learn
LISP.

Also I am thinking to switching to Emacs. Already joined their camp on

Guess it's time to retrospect the last 12 months.

I will be talking about topics that I have worked on or learned. These
are listed in no particular order.

*** *Python*
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: python
    :END:

In June I switched my job and accepted a position of a back-end
developer in a fairly new company with a brand new project. The tech
stack was python and angular. Even though Python was my first love, by
that time I was more of a JavaScript guy rather than a Pythonista.
Luckily I got more than enough support from my team to understand the
implemented code base and in no time I was comfortable enough finish
several Jira tasks.

I have learned Flask as it is the /de facto/ framework for all the
projects we have been building here. I couldn't help but notice how
similar it was to express.js, which in fact helped me accelerating my
learning.

Python is so straight forward and fun, sometimes I wonder why I left it
in the first place.

*** *React*
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: react
    :END:

Even though I have been building React applications for more than two
years, This year, particularly the first half in
[[https://turbot.com][Turbot]] I got an opportunity to build/contribute
to a project which helped me understand the design patterns around a
front-end application, code-splitting, authorization, authentication and
much more.

*** *Touch typing*
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: touch-typing
    :END:

This is something I am actually proud of.

Fortunately I was able to get a job that respects the work life balance
everybody should have. Ironically given the fact that I had little
difference between work and my life(my cat sighs 😾!), I chose to develop
some nerd powers that I have been dreaming to have for a long time.I
have always wanted to learn touch typing since I saw one of my
ex-colleague writing code at 80wpm.

I never actually got time to practice/focus on it until after June, when
I changed my job and joined the above mentioned company. The project was
in its infancy and all I had to do is write code without looking down at
my keyboard. I will admit, it was really tough to break an ancient
practice of peeking and typing until I replaced my keyboard keycaps with
blank ones.

Also [[https://10fastfingers.com/][10fastfingers.com]] and
[[https://www.typingclub.com/][typingclub]] were a great help in
practicing too.

*** *vi*
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: vi
    :END:

This year was monumental for my personal vim experience.

My vim configuration got much matured. Coupling with touch-typing I
almost felt like a Wizard I always wanted to be. I even wrote some posts
on customizing vim for different purposes too.

Pretty good huh!

I have been spending so much time and energy tweaking this website, that I feel
like I should maintain a log for it. No Git commit messages are not enough anymore.
It's kinda fun owning a place on the internet but at the same time it should at
least mean something.

This update brings a list of logs where I will be writing more often now. Logs
will be mostly unimportant and personal(Not that personal).

Also It is a better place to write about personal experiences about non tech
stuff and I don't have to worry about too much for the content. I am having a thought
on writing political articles too. I seriously think the media in India is not
representing different angles to a problem. All I hear is only two sides
where as there could be thousands of views and perspectives to any problem.

I think I gotta give it a try, now that I can.

** Generate beautiful JSON from PostgreSQL :postgresql:json:sql:
   :PROPERTIES:
   :EXPORT_HUGO_SECTION: posts/

   :EXPORT_DATE: 2020-05-19
   :EXPORT_HUGO_CUSTOM_FRONT_MATTER: aliases /post/generate-beautiful-json-from-postgresql
   :END:

PostgreSQL provides a set of built-in [[https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html#FUNCTIONS-JSON-CREATION-TABLE][JSON
creation functions]] that can be used to build basic JSON structures. This increases the performance up to 10 times more than building it at the back-end layer.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  This post is about building different JSON structures using PostgreSQL
  built-in functions. It doesn't talk about storing and manipulating
  JSON in PostgreSQL.
#+END_QUOTE

In order to proceed with some examples, first we need to setup a test
database.

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
  CREATE DATABASE jsonland
#+END_SRC

Let's create the following tables.

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
  CREATE TABLE "user" (
    id SERIAL NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    email_address VARCHAR(150),
    PRIMARY KEY(id)
  )

  CREATE TABLE team (
    id SERIAL NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    PRIMARY KEY(id)
  )

  CREATE TABLE team_user (
    id SERIAL NOT NULL,
    team_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY(team_id) REFERENCES "team" (id),
    FOREIGN KEY(user_id) REFERENCES "user" (id),
    PRIMARY KEY(id)
  )
#+END_SRC

Let's Seed the tables with random data.

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
  INSERT INTO "team" ("id", "name")
  VALUES (1, 'team1'), (2, 'team2');

  INSERT INTO "user" ("id", "name", "email_address")
  VALUES (1, 'user1', 'user1@mail.com'), (2, 'user2', 'user2@mail.com');

  INSERT INTO "team_user" ("id", "team_id", "user_id")
  VALUES (1, 1, 1), (2, 1, 2), (3, 2, 2);
#+END_SRC

We have created three tables i.e. =team=, =user= and =team_user=.
=team_user= table maps one-to-may the relationship between users and
teams.

*** *1. Get the table data as JSON objects*
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: 1-get-the-table-data-as-json-objects
    :END:

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
  SELECT row_to_json("user") FROM "user";

  +-----------------------------------------------------------+
  | row_to_json                                               |
  |-----------------------------------------------------------|
  | {"id":1,"name":"user1","email_address":"user1@gmail.com"} |
  | {"id":2,"name":"user2","email_address":"user2@gmail.com"} |
  +-----------------------------------------------------------+
#+END_SRC

The above mentioned query will return all the columns of each row as
JSON objects.

*** *2. Get the table data with specific columns*
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: 2-get-the-table-data-with-specific-columns
    :END:

We can specify the particular columns we need rather than getting all at
once.

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
  SELECT row_to_json(row('id', 'name')) FROM "user";

  +-------------------------+
  | row_to_json             |
  |-------------------------|
  | {"f1":"id","f2":"name"} |
  | {"f1":"id","f2":"name"} |
  +-------------------------+
#+END_SRC

Now certainly the keys =f1= and =f2= in the objects are not very useful
to us. We would rather want the column names instead of those keys.

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
  SELECT row_to_json(users) FROM (SELECT id, name FROM "user") AS users;

  +-------------------------+
  | row_to_json             |
  |-------------------------|
  | {"id":1,"name":"user1"} |
  | {"id":2,"name":"user2"} |
  +-------------------------+
#+END_SRC

*** *3. Get the table data as a single JSON object*
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: 3-get-the-table-data-as-a-single-json-object
    :END:

The above examples return us multiple JSON objects(one for each row).
Ideally we would want a single array of these objects which won't need
any further manipulation at back-end layer.

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
  SELECT array_to_json(array_agg(row_to_json(users)))
      FROM (
          SELECT id, name from "user"
      ) users

  -- OR

  SELECT json_agg(row_to_json(users))
      FROM (
          SELECT id, name from "user"
      ) users

  +----------------------------------------------------+
  | json_agg                                           |
  |----------------------------------------------------|
  | [{"id":1,"name":"user1"}, {"id":2,"name":"user2"}] |
  +----------------------------------------------------+
#+END_SRC

In the above query we are aggregating all the JSON objects and using
=array_agg= and then converting them to JSON by applying =array_to_json=
function.

Also we could do the yield the same results by using =json_agg=
function, which results into an object instead of JSON string.

*** *4. Build JSON object with multiple tables*
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: 4-build-json-object-with-multiple-tables
    :END:

We can also build a new JSON object by using =json_build_object= and
specify the keys and values. Let's create an object that will contain
data from both team and user table.

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
  SELECT json_build_object(
    'users', (SELECT json_agg(row_to_json("user")) from "user"),
    'teams', (SELECT json_agg(row_to_json("team")) from "team")
  )
#+END_SRC

This query generates a JSON structure that will have all the users and
teams each as arrays of objects.

#+BEGIN_SRC json
  {
    "users": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "user1",
        "email_address": "user1@mail.com"
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "name": "user2",
        "email_address": "user2@mail.com"
      }
    ],
    "teams": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "team1"
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "name": "team2"
      }
    ]
  }
#+END_SRC

*** *5. Build JSON object by resolving foreign keys*
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: 5-build-json-object-by-resolving-foreign-keys
    :END:

We can generate JSON structures by resolving foreign key references and
joining multiple tables.

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
  select json_agg(row_to_json(tu))
      from (
          select id, (
              select row_to_json(team) from team where team_user.team_id = team.id
          ) team, (
              select row_to_json("user") from "user" where team_user.user_id = "user".id
          ) "user"
      from team_user
  ) tu
#+END_SRC

This query contains multiple sub-queries to generate a complex
structure. It resolved the references of =team_id= and =user_id= into
the corresponding row.

#+BEGIN_SRC json
[
    {
      "id": 1,
      "team": {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "team1"
      },
      "user": {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "user1",
        "email_address": "user1@mail.com"
      }
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "team": {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "team1"
      },
      "user": {
        "id": 2,
        "name": "user2",
        "email_address": "user2@mail.com"
      }
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "team": {
        "id": 2,
        "name": "team2"
      },
      "user": {
        "id": 2,
        "name": "user2",
        "email_address": "user2@mail.com"
      }
    }
  ]
#+END_SRC

*** *Conclusion*
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: conclusion
    :END:

Even though PostgreSQL is almost always faster than the back-end
language based JSON generation, the query can get complex really quickly
as we have nested structures. As long as we understand the basic JSON
functions and sub-queries we can build almost any kind of structure
without stressing the back-end processes.
** Building a GitHub authentication service :github:auth:flask:python:

   :EXPORT_DATE: 2020-04-11
   :EXPORT_HUGO_CUSTOM_FRONT_MATTER: aliases /post/building-a-github-auth-service
   :END:

Recently I was building a GitHub OAuth app to authentiacate one my
client-side application with GitHub. The application was all about
taking notes and maintaining them on a private repository. I have had
worked on such an architecture in one of my previous jobs where we have
used [[https://aws.amazon.com/codecommit/][AWS CodeCommit]] as an
inventory of resources where the history and the changes were easier to
maintain. So for me GitHub was the perfect choice as a free storage with
elegant history/commit management.

Like most OAuth process it was not so straightforward even though at
first glance it seemed so.

*** *The GitHub OAuth process*
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: the-github-oauth-process
    :END:

After going through the GitHub's [[https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps/][guide]] and a bunch of other development blogs I came up with a set of steps.

1. First we need to create an OAuth application. The steps to create one are mentioned [[https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app/][here]].

2. Once we create an OAuth application, we need to call the GitHub API
   for an authentication code. This API call looks something like this.

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize?client_id=0000000000000&scope=repo&redirect_uri=https://xyz.io/myapp/
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   This redirects to the redirect_uri with an authentication code which
   looks something like this.

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     https://xyz.io/myapp/?code=a17ccd77d36b2be92aa4
   #+END_EXAMPLE

3. After getting the code, we need to make a POST call to get the
   access_token.

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       curl --location --request POST 'https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token' \
       --header 'Cookie: _octo=GH1.1.206637387.1578955864; logged_in=no' \
       --form 'client_id=xxxxxxxxxxxxxx' \
       --form 'client_secret=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx' \
       --form 'code=a17ccd77d36b2be92aa4'
   #+END_SRC

4. Once we have the access_token we can start making call to GitHub and
   interact with repositories. Here is an example to get the current
   user details.

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       curl -H "Authorization: 2434543442242394sfes34dds" https://api.github.com/user
   #+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Follow the official
  [[https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps/#web-application-flow][web-application-flow]]
  guide for more details and all possible parameters of the
  authentication APIs.
#+END_QUOTE

*** *Why do we need a back-end server*
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: why-do-we-need-a-back-end-server
    :END:

Now with the above four steps it does look simple, doesn't it?

Well no! We really don't want to reveal our client secret to a possible
attacker, who in turn can get access to all the users and possibly their
repositories who had authorized this OAuth application. There is no
safer way to make the 3rd step from a client-side application without
revealing the client secret.

To securely call the POST API we need a back-end proxy where we can
store the client secret and make the call. The proxy could be an old
fashioned server as well as a serverless function hosted on a cloud
provider.

*** *The proxy*
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: the-proxy
    :END:
    We will be needing only one GET API on the proxy/server to authenticate
our client-side application. We will pre-configure our proxy/server with
client id and client secret and will accept the authentication code as a
parameter for the API.

The API call to the proxy/server should look something like this.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  https://your-proxy.glitch.me/authenticate/a17ccd77d36b2be92aa4
#+END_EXAMPLE

Here we are using Python and Flask to build the server, but it can be
any stack of your choice.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
    @app.route("/authenticate/<code>", methods=["GET"])
    def authenticate(code):
        creds = get_access_token(*build_config(code))
        return jsonify(creds)


    def build_config(code):
        url = config["oauth_url"]
        headers = {"Content-Type": "application/json"}
        payload = {
            "client_id": os.environ.get(config["oauth_client_id"]),
            "client_secret": os.environ.get(config["oauth_client_secret"]),
            "code": code,
        }
        # Raise exceptions if client_id or client_secret not found.
        if not payload["client_id"]:
            raise APIException("Client Id is not found in environment", status_code=422)
        if not payload["client_secret"]:
            raise APIException("Client secret is not found in environment", status_code=422)
        return url, headers, payload


    def get_access_token(url, headers, payload):
        response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, params=payload)
        # If client id not found
        if response.text == "Not Found":
            raise APIException("Client id is invalid", status_code=404)
        qs = dict(parse_qsl(response.text))
        creds = {item: qs[item] for item in qs}
        return creds
#+END_SRC

Here we are storing the client id and client secret as environment
variable and using them to build the required parameters for the POST
call. We are also wrapping the default error message with a more
sophisticated one.

*** *Conclusion*
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: conclusion
    :END:

This kind of design is pretty common with most OAuth authentication
processes. Here for hosting I have used [[https://glitch.com/][Glitch]]
as it is free and easy to maintain. If you are expecting an high volume
of requests, a more serious server would be a better choice.

that I discovered geeking around the internet.

I was building a tiny
[[https://github.com/solitudenote/gitkeeper][microservice]] which would
let the client side application securely authenticate with GitHub. After
writing the only required API, I wanted to render the /README.md/ file
on the index page.

So I planned to convert markdown to html and serve the resultant string
everytime we hit the index.

/Required packages/

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  pip3 install Flask markdown
#+END_SRC

/app.py/

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  import markdown
  from flask import Flask
  import markdown.extensions.fenced_code

  app = Flask(__name__)


  @app.route("/")
  def index():
      readme_file = open("README.md", "r")
      md_template_string = markdown.markdown(
          readme_file.read(), extensions=["fenced_code"]
      )

      return md_template_string


  if __name__ == "__main__":
      app.run()
#+END_SRC

In the above snippet we are using [[https://flask.palletsprojects.com][Flask]](my current favorite) as the web framework, [[https://github.com/Python-Markdown/markdown][Python-Markdown]] to convert markdown files to HTML, and [[https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/fenced_code_blocks/][fenced_code]] extension to support code blocks.

And it looked something like this

#+BEGIN_EXPORT HTML
  <div class="post-image">
    <img src="/images/markdown-render-plain.png" />
  </div>
#+END_EXPORT

Well even though [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman][Richard Stallman]] remains my hero, fortunately I do not share his [[https://stallman.org/][taste]] on web design. So without
over-engineering our little snippet I thought of adding syntax highlighting with [[https://pygments.org/][pygments]] and [[https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/code_hilite/][CodeHilite]] extension.

Let's generate css for syntax highlighting using pygments

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  from pygments.formatters import HtmlFormatter

  formatter = HtmlFormatter(style="emacs",full=True,cssclass="codehilite")
  css_string = formatter.get_style_defs()
#+END_SRC

Now we need to append the css_string to the markdown converted HTML string.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  md_css_string = "<style>" + css_string + "</style>"
  md_template = md_css_string + md_template_string
  return md_template
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Alternatively we can use
  [[https://github.com/richleland/pygments-css][pygments-css]]
  repository to get pre-generated CSS files.
#+END_QUOTE

Let's see how the final version looks!

#+BEGIN_EXPORT HTML
  <div class="post-image">
    <img src="/images/markdown-render-hl.png" />
  </div>
#+END_EXPORT

** Setting up a task scheduler in Flask :python:flask:celery:

   :EXPORT_DATE: 2019-11-30

   :END:

The first thing that comes to mind while considering a task scheduler is
a cron job. As most of the today's servers are hosted on linux machines,
setting a cron job for periodic task might seem like a good option for
many. However in production having a crontab is nothing but a pain in
the a**. It can be a bit tricky to configure different timezones
depending upon the location of the server.

The biggest problem with this approach is when the application is scaled
into multiple web servers. In that case instead of running one we could
be running multiple cron jobs which might lead to race conditions. Also
it's hard to debug if something goes wrong with the task.

With Flask there are multiple ways to address third problem and
[[http://www.celeryproject.org/][Celery]] is one of the most popular
ones. Celery addresses the above problems quite gracefully. It uses same
timezones of [[https://pypi.org/project/pytz/][pytz]] which helps in
calculating timezones and setting the scheduler timings accurately.

Celery uses a backend message broker (redis or RabbitMQ) to save the
state of the schedule which acts as a centralized database server for
multiple celery workers running on different web servers.The message
broker ensures that the task is run only once as per the schedule, hence
eliminating the race condition.

Monitoring real time events is also supported by Celery. It includes a
beautiful built-in terminal interface that shows all the current
events.A nice standalone project
[[https://flower.readthedocs.io/en/latest/][Flower]] provides a web
based tool to administer Celery workers and tasks.It also supports
asynchronous task execution which comes in handy for long running tasks.

  Here we will be using a dockerized environment. Now the installation
  of redis and celery can be different from system to system and docker
  environments are pretty common now a days to do such kind of exercises
  without worrying so much about local dev infrastructure.
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  flask-celery
  │
  │  app.py
  │  docker-compose.yml
  │  Dockerfile
  │  entrypoint.sh
  │  requirements.txt
  │
  └────────────────────────
#+END_EXAMPLE

Let's start with the Dockerfile

#+BEGIN_SRC dockerfile
  FROM python:3.7

  # Create a directory named flask
  RUN mkdir flask

  # Copy everything to flask folder
  COPY . /flask/

  # Make flask as working directory
  WORKDIR /flask

  # Install the Python libraries
  RUN pip3 install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

  EXPOSE 5000

  # Run the entrypoint script
  CMD ["bash", "entrypoint.sh"]
#+END_SRC

The packages required for this application are mentioned in the
requirement.txt file.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  Flask==1.0.2
  celery==4.3.0
  redis==3.3.11
#+END_EXAMPLE

The entry point script goes here.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  #!/bin/sh

  flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port 5000
#+END_SRC

Celery uses a message broker to pass messages between the web app and
celery workers. Here we will setup a Redis container which will be used
as the message broker.

#+BEGIN_SRC dockerfile
  version: "3.7"

  services:

    redis:
      container_name: redis_dev_container
      image: redis
      ports:
        - "6379:6379"

    flask_service:
      container_name: flask_dev_container
      restart: always
      image: flask
      build:
        context: ./
        dockerfile: Dockerfile
      depends_on:
          - redis
      ports:
        - "5000:5000"
      volumes:
        - ./:/flask
      environment:
          - FLASK_DEBUG=1
#+END_SRC

Now we are all set to start our little experiment. We have a redis
container running on port 6379 and a flask container running on
=localhost:5000=. Let's add a simple api to test whether our tiny web
application works.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  from flask import Flask

  app = Flask(__name__)

  @app.route("/")
  def index_view():
      return "Flask-celery task scheduler!"

  if __name__ == "__main__":
      app.run()
#+END_SRC

And voila!

#+BEGIN_EXPORT HTML
  <div class="post-image">
    <img src="/images/hello-scheduler.png" />
  </div>
#+END_EXPORT

Now we will be building a simple timer application which will show the
elapsed time since the application has started. We need to configure
celery with the Redis server URL and also we will be using another Redis
database to store the time.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  from flask import Flask
  from celery import Celery
  import redis

  app = Flask(__name__)

  # Add Redis URL configurations
  app.config["CELERY_BROKER_URL"] = "redis://redis:6379/0"
  app.config["CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND"] = "redis://redis:6379/0"

  # Connect Redis db
  redis_db = redis.Redis(
      host="redis", port="6379", db=1, charset="utf-8", decode_responses=True
  )

  # Initialize timer in Redis
  redis_db.mset({"minute": 0, "second": 0})

  # Add periodic tasks
  celery_beat_schedule = {
      "time_scheduler": {
          "task": "app.timer",
          # Run every second
          "schedule": 1.0,
      }
  }

# Initialize Celery and update its config
celery = Celery(app.name)
celery.conf.update(
    result_backend=app.config["CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND"],
    broker_url=app.config["CELERY_BROKER_URL"],
    timezone="UTC",
    task_serializer="json",
    accept_content=["json"],
    result_serializer="json",
    beat_schedule=celery_beat_schedule,
)


@app.route("/")
def index_view():
    return "Flask-celery task scheduler!"


@app.route("/timer")
def timer_view():
    time_counter = redis_db.mget(["minute", "second"])
    return f"Minute: {time_counter[0]}, Second: {time_counter[1]}"


@celery.task
def timer():
    second_counter = int(redis_db.get("second")) + 1
    if second_counter >= 59:
        # Reset the counter
        redis_db.set("second", 0)
        # Increment the minute
        redis_db.set("minute", int(redis_db.get("minute")) + 1)
    else:
        # Increment the second
        redis_db.set("second", second_counter)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
#+END_SRC

Let's update the =entrypoint.js= to run both Celery worker and beat
server as background processes.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  #!/bin/sh

  # Run Celery worker
  celery -A app.celery worker --loglevel=INFO --detach --pidfile=''

  # Run Celery Beat
  celery -A app.celery beat --loglevel=INFO --detach --pidfile=''

  flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port 5000
#+END_SRC

Our very own timer

#+BEGIN_EXPORT HTML

    <img src="/images/timer.png" />
  </div>
#+END_EXPORT

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  The application is only for demonstration purpose. The counter won't
  be accurate as the task processing time is not taken into account
  while calculating time.
#+END_QUOTE

*** *Monitoring events*
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: monitoring-events
    :END:

Celery has a rich support for monitoring various statistics for tasks,
workers and events. We need to log into the container to enable and
monitor events.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  docker exec -it flask_dev_container bash
#+END_SRC

Enable and list all events

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  celery -A app.celery control enable_events

  celery -A app.celery events
#+END_SRC

This spins up a nice interactive terminal ui listing all the details of
the scheduled tasks.

  </div>
#+END_EXPORT

*** *Conclusion*
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: conclusion
    :END:

In this post I have used Celery as an better alternative to crontabs
even though the primary purpose of Celery is processing tasks queues.
Both Celery worker and beat server can be run on different containers as
running background processes on the web container is not regarded as
best practice.

Unless you are creating a stupid timer application.

** A floating terminal for (Neo)vim :vim:neovim:editor:productivity:

   :EXPORT_DATE: 2019-10-12
   :EXPORT_HUGO_CUSTOM_FRONT_MATTER: aliases /post/a-floating-terminal-for-vim
   :END:

I love working in terminal and editing with
[[https://neovim.io/][(Neo)vim]]. Though I have been using vim since my
college days, for past two years I am using it as my full-time editor.

I remember vividly when I first switched to vim at work. It was a
horrible experience for the first week which made me flood my vimrc file
with plugins to make it work. I have definitely moved past that phase
and learned to [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1218390/what-is-your-most-productive-shortcut-with-vim/1220118#1220118][grok]] vi since then.

Even now sometimes I tend to miss many nicer features of a full blown
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment][IDE]],
like better language support, familiar clipboard management and inbuilt
terminal support. Thanks to the developers of Neovim, vim users can use
the full potential of terminal without quitting or stopping the editor

Last week I came across a plugin named
[[https://github.com/voldikss/vim-floaterm][vim-termfloat]] which uses
Neovim's floating window and I realized that I have been(subconsciously)
wanting this feature for a really long time. This plugin lets me open my
terminal, restart my server, close the terminal and get back to my
editor with a few keystrokes.

#+BEGIN_SRC vim
  " Float baby float
  Plugin 'voldikss/vim-floaterm'
#+END_SRC

I have also remapped my =<leader>t= to toggle the floating terminal.

#+BEGIN_SRC vim
  noremap  <leader>t  :FloatermToggle<CR>i
  noremap! <leader>t  <Esc>:FloatermToggle<CR>i
  tnoremap <leader>t  <C-\><C-n>:FloatermToggle<CR>
#+END_SRC

I have resized the terminal window and set the transparency to zero.

#+BEGIN_SRC vim
  let g:floaterm_width = 100
  let g:floaterm_winblend = 0
#+END_SRC

Time for some action then! Let's quickly run a python script without
bothering to leave the window.

#+BEGIN_EXPORT HTML
  <div class="post-image">

post.

#+BEGIN_EXPORT HTML

    <img src="/images/gatsby-dev.gif" />
  </div>
#+END_EXPORT


Yeah of course I can still use the in built terminal of neovim in a
different pane or window, but this plugin really makes it easy.

Anyways I did a lot of research on effectively creating these gif files.
Well that's for another post.

   :END:

Flask is one of the most used python frameworks for web development. Its
simplicity and extensibility makes it convenient for both small and
large applications alike.

In this blog we are going to create a simple flask web application that
will generate and serve files without storing them in the server.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Note: For flask and python installation visit
  [[https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/][flask documentation]]
#+END_QUOTE

Let's create a flask application with a basic route.

#+BEGIN_SRC python

  from flask import Flask

  app = Flask(__name__)


  @app.route("/")
  def index():
      return "Hello Flask!"
#+END_SRC

and voila! We have our server up and running with only 5 lines of code.

Now we need to create a route which will accept a file name as
parameter.

#+BEGIN_SRC python

  @app.route("/file/<file_name>")
  def get_file(file_name):
      return file_name
#+END_SRC

For our use case we need to generate a csv file using fake data.We need
to install [[https://github.com/joke2k/faker][faker]] to generate fake
data such as name, address, birthdate etc. Also we are using
[[https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas][pandas]] to generate dataframes
that can be used to create both csv and spreadsheets.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh

  python3 -m pip install faker pandas
#+END_SRC

Let's add functions that will generate csv files using the fake data we
get from Faker.

#+BEGIN_SRC python

  def generate_fake_data():
      fake_data = [fake.simple_profile() for item in range(5)]
      return pd.DataFrame(fake_data)


  def generate_csv_file(file_df):
      # Create an o/p buffer
      file_buffer = StringIO()

      # Write the dataframe to the buffer
      file_df.to_csv(file_buffer, encoding="utf-8", index=False, sep=",")

      # Seek to the beginning of the stream
      file_buffer.seek(0)
      return file_buffer
#+END_SRC

Now we need to call these functions from our routing method and send the
file as response.

#+BEGIN_SRC python

  @app.route("/file/<file_name>")
  def get_file(file_name):
      fake_df = generate_fake_data()
      generated_file = generate_csv_file(fake_df)
      response = Response(generated_file, mimetype="text/csv")
      # add a filename
      response.headers.set(
          "Content-Disposition", "attachment", filename="{0}.csv".format(file_name)
      )
      return response

#+END_SRC

Once we hit the above route with a file name the browser will ask for
permission to download the csv file.

Here is the full source code with a working example.

It's been 8 months since I have been using (neo)vim as my primary text
editor. Initially it was incredibly tough to adopt and use it in work.
Well that would be another story to tell.

Back then I was working mostly in backend using
[[https://coffeescript.org/][CoffeeScript]] (I know 🙈). VS Code had a
little support for CoffeeScript so I didn't had any problems using vim
full time.

But things changed drastically when I moved into UI development this
year. I had to spend hours reading blogs, threads on reddit to create at
least a workable setup for a hassle-less React enviornment. Here I am
sharing my vim setup for JS/React development.

*** *Syntax Highlighting*
    :PROPERTIES:

Out of the box vim/nvim supports syntax highlighting for major
programming languages.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash

#+END_SRC

[[https://github.com/mxw/vim-jsx][vim-jsx]] is by far the best jsx
plugin for vim.
[[https://github.com/pangloss/vim-javascript][vim-javascript]] provides
better syntax highlighting and code folding support compared to the
default one.

#+BEGIN_SRC vim
  Plugin 'mxw/vim-jsx'
  Plugin 'pangloss/vim-javascript'
#+END_SRC

But It is yet to add =jsx= to its inventory. Also there are some
javascript specific plugins that makes syntax highlighting much better.

*** *Linters and Formatters*
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: linters-and-formatters
    :END:

Well everyone has a love hate relationship with linters. Nobody likes
those annoying red lines on the editor the moment they add a newline.

But with vim You are in luck. [[https://github.com/w0rp/ale][ALE]] is a
nice plugin that asynchronously checks for syntatical errors in the
code. It supports mnay language specific linters and formatters. ALE
also lets people configure the signs for errors and warnings.

#+BEGIN_SRC vim
  Plugin 'w0rp/ale'
#+END_SRC

For JS/React development to add =eslint= as a linter and =prettier= I
added this to my vimrc

#+BEGIN_SRC vim
  let g:ale_linters = {
    \ 'javascript': ['eslint'],
    \}

  let g:ale_fixers = {
    \ 'javascript': ['prettier', 'eslint']
    \ }
#+END_SRC

I also mapped =leader+d= as my ale fixer and configured to format each
time I save the file.

#+BEGIN_SRC vim
  let g:ale_fix_on_save = 1
  nmap <leader>d <Plug>(ale_fix)

*** *Commenting*
:PROPERTIES:

Though this is not specific to any particular language I would like to
discuss an excellent plugin which is pretty good at commenting and
uncommenting code.

With vim it's hard to find an universal config that suits everyone. It's
always solving one problem at a time that led me here. This is
definitely not a full fledge solution to this but it seems to work
pretty well for me. So if you have any suggestion feel free to ping me

I recently left a huge IT corporation for a promising startup.I was
asked to change my GitHub handler name as it was too cool(I think) for
them.Well instead of changing I created another account using my company
email.

Now I got a problem.Every day when I come home and start hacking around
my own projects I had to manually set my username and email id in git
config in order to reflect my contributions in the graph and most of the
time I forget to do so.

So I created some aliases to toggle between my two handles.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  # Set user 1 as current user
  gitfirst() {
      git config --global user.email 'xxx.yyyy@gmail.com' && git config --global user.name 'mrprofessor'

  # Set user 2 as current user
  gitsecond() {
      git config --global user.email 'zzzzz@corporation.com' && git config --global user.name 'rudrabot'
      gituser
  }

  # Print current user
  gituser() {
      git config --global user.name && git config --global user.email
  }

For people who work in a company and squeez out some of their time to
learn nodejs, setting up an dev-environment can be a real pain. Proxy
servers are pretty common in college and business type institutions.

You can locate your proxy settings from your browser's settings panel.

*** *Using Proxy with NPM*
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: using-proxy-with-npm
    :END:

Once you have obtained the proxy settings (server URL, port, username
and password); you need to configure your npm configurations as follows.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  npm config set proxy http://<username>:<password>@<proxy-server-url>:<port>
  npm config set https-proxy http://<username>:<password>@<proxy-server-url>:<port>
#+END_SRC

You would have to replace =<username>=, =<password>=,
=<proxy-server-url>=, =<port>= with the values specific to your proxy
server credentials.

These fields are optional. For instance, your proxy server might not
even require =<username>= and =<password>=, or that it might be running
on port 80 (in which case =<port>= is not required).

Once you have set these, your npm install, =npm i -g etc=. would work
properly.

The earliest computers were often programmed without the help of a
programming language, by writing programs in absolute machine language.
The programs, in decimal or binary form (mostly binary),were read in
from punched cards or magnetic tape or toggled in on switches on the
front panel of the computer. I guess they started creating programming
languages in order to make it human readable. Then they developed
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-generation_programming_language][First
Gen]],
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-generation_programming_language][Assembly
languages]](/Ah..my first project/) and created something called
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language][
high-level programming language]].

But we didn't stop there, did we ? We had C,we got Python, a more
readable yet slow language.People wrote languages like Basic, Scratch,
Ruby to make things more simple and people loved it.Okay...We are there
now. Everything was going alright..perfect..superb in the IT Programming
industry until when some guys got really serious about JavaScript.I
guess that's the reason I am writing this blog now.

I was in college when I learned web developement. At that time Frontend
developers are not actually called developers but designers. I often
took my time off from those grumpy sorting algorithms and writing C and
used to geek off with these top three. *HTML*, *CSS* and
*JavaScript*.Well practically less JavaScript and more *jQuery*. They
were so addictive for a curious guy like me who used to draw his
imaginations on a 15.6 inch screen.Nobody really cared about JavaScript
back then...everyone was so focused on backend like php,asp,django and
hipster rails.

The space was completely occupied by JQuery with more readable and
easily writable syntax.Ajax implementation was easy, people don't have
to remember those =getElementById('blah..blah') = kinda functions.Coming
to CSS, writing CSS was absolutely fun until smaller devices came.
People needed better looking websites on their phone rather than
squeezed down version of websites.Hence designers started writing media
queries(/It took me a whole year to understand =@media queries=/) and
grids to make sites responsive.

Then a guy at [[https://twitter.com][Twitter]] developed a front-end
framework called Bootstrap and the whole world just started drooling
over it. It was awesome to use..developers don't had to waste a day to
design grids or write media queries.But the problem started when people
considered this anything more than a framework. Videos got published,
books got written to learn Bootstrap. Now a newbie has to learn
HTML,CSS,and Bootstrap instead of just the former two.

  So Instead of learning how these grids and navbar works, they just
  started using it.
#+END_QUOTE

Same thing also happened to JavaScript.People almost forgot that they
can really write an web app by just using pure HTML, CSS and
Javascript(/Now they are calling it Vanilla JavaScript/).There was
JQuery for quite sometime till angular came.People started using
JavaScript in backend,thanks to /node.js/. Then came /Vue.js/,
/Ember.js/, /Meteor.js/, /React.js/ and more. And surprisingly some of
them don't even use JavaScript, instead they use languages that
transpiles to JavaScript.

#+BEGIN_EXPORT HTML
  <!-- It's completely understandable when a lazy programmer(_Well all are lazy_) creates one such language so that he and his company don't have to write lengthy JavaScript all the time, why others are jumping there ditching the core language?? In countries like India,China people are following the same pattern where connectivity is not at it's best yet. -->

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  See what happened to /Angular/..!! They rewrote the whole framework
  and created /Angular 2/. React JS is unstable like an active Volcano.

I am not completely against it. All that's happening is good, I surely
have nothing against any X framework or Y library. Just teach the
newbies the basic first. They need to know both the pro's and con's of
any library or framework instead of the /"This framework is so cool..!!
coz that company backs it."/ trend.
