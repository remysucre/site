Though I have been using vim since my college days, for past two years I am using it as my full-time editor.
I remember vividly when I first switched to vim at work. It was a horrible experience for the first week which made me flood my vimrc file with plugins to make it work. I have definitely moved past that phase and learned to grok vi since then.</description></item><item><title>Setting up (Neo)vim for React development</title><link>https://rudra.dev/posts/setting-up-vim-for-react/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 May 2019 00:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rudra.dev/posts/setting-up-vim-for-react/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s been 8 months since I have been using (neo)vim as my primary text editor. Initially it was incredibly tough to adopt and use it in work. Well that would be another story to tell.
Back then I was working mostly in backend using CoffeeScript (I know 🙈). VS Code had a little support for CoffeeScript so I didn&amp;rsquo;t had any problems using vim full time.
But things changed drastically when I moved into UI development this year.</description></item></channel></rss>
